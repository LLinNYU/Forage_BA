## Forage_BA
The Forage: British Airways is a job simulation that involves web scraping, analyzing data, and creating a predictive model to answer realistic business questions such as "What about the company's services do customers mention and what are their critiques?" and "What are the factors considered in a customer's confirmation of a purchase?"  
This simulation introduced me to web scraping as well as how machine learning systems make sense of natural language tasks and gave me more hands-on practice with classification models. 
The relevant python notebooks are Part_1_Data_Overview.ipynb and Part_2_Predictive_Model.ipynb.
